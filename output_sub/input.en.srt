00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
Mr. President, we asked our viewers if they had questions, here are a couple.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,340
Jamie T. from Virginia said one of your biggest messages in campaign slogans was drain the

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,340
swamp.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,120
But the idea that serving the American people is a privilege and not a career, and the politicians

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,780
are supposed to answer to the American people and not the opposite, when will your administration

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,600
be putting together a proposal for term limits for Congress?

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,510
Well, we're looking into that right now.

8
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:27,710
Right now, I want to get those congressmen to go and approve Obamacare and all the different

9
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:28,710
things that we're working on.

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:29,710
One step at a time.

11
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,710
We'll be doing it, really.

12
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,350
I mean, that's something down the road a little bit.

13
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,970
A lot of people don't like that, frankly, you know, they consider term limits to be

14
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,470
an election, but I think it would be a good thing.

15
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:42,450
But right now, what I want to do is get Obamacare approved and I want people to love us.

16
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,450
Approved or changed?

17
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:49,610
Well, really, well, changed when I say Obamacare, I mean, I'm talking about real change.

18
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:53,430
And I suspect the first thing that's going to change will be the name, but we're talking

19
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,770
about repealing and replacing.

20
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,910
And if we don't do that, I would be very upset.

21
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,220
Nobody's going to get thrown out of their insurance, are they?

22
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,300
Because that's what a lot of people are saying on the left.

23
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,360
They're saying millions of people

24
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,200
are gonna lose the insurance.

25
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,040
No, they have it all wrong,

26
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,960
and you're gonna hear about it during the speech,

27
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,820
but they have it all wrong.

28
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,520
We're gonna have a really great healthcare plan,

29
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,960
and it's gonna be much more affordable,

30
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,140
including for the country.

31
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:16,980
Go ahead.

32
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,920
Now, I know when you were inaugurated,

33
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,870
you put your hand on your Bible that your mother had given you as a child. I know when you were inaugurated used you put

34
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:24,030
your hand on your Bible that your mother given you as a child I know as a mother

35
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,870
as parents we pray for our children we want the best for them and your parents

36
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:32,670
they probably prayed for you so much but maybe not they might not have realized

37
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,190
that you were gonna get this far and I know they would be very proud of you

38
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:41,850
that leads me to this question Ronald wrote us and said I, I pray for you daily. Do you take time to pray?

39
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,890
I do, actually. And to me, it's very important. But that's so nice. Who is that?

40
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:47,890
That's Ronald.

41
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,450
Wow. Hello, Ronald. We ought to bring Ronald to the White House.

42
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,570
He'd be happy to come.

43
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,570
I like Ronald.

44
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:57,820
And this is the last one. Alan Sherman from Queens says, I'm a diehard New York Mets fan since you're a native of the

45
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,560
Great borough of Queens, but moved to Manhattan. Are you a Mets fan or a Yankees fan?

46
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,560
The fate of the world relies on this answer

47
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:10,320
Well, I don't think it does but actually I do like both teams and I love the Steinbrenner family and the Will Pond family and

48
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:15,470
Randy Levine and the whole group they Randy has done a terrific job he's involved

49
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,470
with the Yankees now you're probably gonna win New York well I don't know but

50
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,950
I do like both teams I really do what about Social Security people my age are

51
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,870
worried that it might run out by the time we need it you're gonna be okay

52
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,270
that was Ainsley from Manhattan
